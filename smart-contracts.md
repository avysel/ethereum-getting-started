# First steps with Ethereum smart contracts

## Tools

- [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/index.html): to test and deploy smart contracts
- [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/): an Ethereum blockchain simulator for smart contract development.
- [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/): online smart contract IDE. Allows to write, test and deploy smart contracts.
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/): browser extension to manage accounts from any Ethereum network
- [Cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/): online tool to learn Solidity by developping a small game.
- [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/)


## Build with Truffle

Truffle is a Javascript command line tool used to compile, test and deploy smart contracts.

1. Install and init Truffle: https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/quickstart.html

2. Configure Truffle to used the network you want: https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/reference/configuration

3. Create a deployment file for you contract (Migration file): https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/running-migrations.html

4. Write smart contract and compile: https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/compiling-contracts.html

5. Test your smart contract: https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/testing/testing-your-contracts.html

6. Deploy on blockchain: https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/running-migrations.html


## Build with Remix

Remix is an online IDE to develop and deploy smart contracts.

Easier to deploy, but not as strong as Truffle to create build process.
